Currently the inflation rate of the hub is not very reactive to unbond shocks (as seen above). This can lead to network security risks if an economic actor with bad intent wanted to try and destabilize the hub. On the other hand, changing any variable within a system can cause unwanted consequences. There is no way to get rid of this risk entirely, luckily the inflation mechanics are fairly simple and easy to model with excel spreadsheets.

Changing this variable will undoubtedly greatly increase the reactivity of the hub to unbonding shocks. Overall, this seems very beneficial due to the extremely slow reaction time of the hub currently. Also, it brings the hub closer to the original goal of 1 year from the min to the max in a unbonding shock scenario.
