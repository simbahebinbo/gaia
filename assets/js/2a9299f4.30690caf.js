A governance proposal is only considered eligible for voting by the whole validator set if a certain amount of staking token is deposited on the proposal. The intention is that the deposit will be burned if a proposal is spam or has caused a negative externality to the Cosmos community (such as wasting stakeholders\u2019 time having to review the proposal).nnIn the current implementation of the governance module used in the Cosmos Hub, the deposit is burned if a proposal does not pass, regardless of how close the final tally result may have been. For example, if 49% of stake votes in favor of a proposal while 51% votes against it, the deposit will still be burned. This seems to be an undesirable behavior as it disincentivizes anyone from creating or depositing on a proposal that might be slightly contentious but not spam, due to fear of losing the deposit minimum (currently 512 atoms). This will especially be the case as TextProposals will be used for signaling purposes, to gauge the sentiment of staked Atom holders. Disincentivizing proposals for which the outcome is uncertain would undermine that effort.nnWe instead propose that the deposit be returned on failed votes, and that the deposit only be burned on vetoed votes. If a proposal seems to be spam or is deemed to have caused a negative externality to Cosmos communninty, voters should vote NoWithVeto on the proposal. If >33% of the stake chooses to Veto a proposal, the deposits will then be burned. However, if a proposal gets rejected without being vetoed, the deposits should be returned to the depositors. This proposal does not make any change to the current behavior for proposals that fail to meet quorum; if a proposal fails to meet quorum its deposit will be burned."),(0,s.kt)("h2",{id:"7-activate-the-community-pool"},"7 Activate the Community Pool"),(0,s.kt)("ul",null,(0,s.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,s.kt)("strong",{parentName:"li"},"Submitted:")," 2019-05-03T21:08:25.443199036Z"),(0,s.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,s.kt)("strong",{parentName:"li"},"Status:")," PROPOSAL_STATUS_PASSED"),(0,s.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,s.kt)("strong",{parentName:"li"},"Type:")," /cosmos.gov.v1beta1.TextProposal")),(0,s.kt)("p",null,"Enable governance to spend funds from the community pool.

This number was chosen as a relatively conservative estimate, as at the time of writing, it was unclear how many widely distributed nodes Tendermint consensus could scale to over the public internet. nnHowever, since then, we have seen empirically through the running of the Game of Stakes incentivized testnet that Tendermint Core with Gaia state machine can operate with over 180 validators at reasonable average block times of <7 seconds. The Game of Stakes results empirically show that adding validators should not delay consensus at small block sizes. At large block sizes, the time it takes for the block to gossip to all validators may increase depending on the newfound network topology. However we view this as unlikely, and if it did become a problem, it could later be solved by known improvements at the p2p layer. The other tradeoff to increasing the number of validators is that the size of commits becomes ~25% larger due to more precommits being included, increasing the network and storage costs for nodes. This can also be resolved in the future with the integration of aggregate signatures. At the time of submission of this proposal, the minimum delegation to become a top 100 validator is 30,600 Atoms, a fairly high barrier to entry for new validators looking to enter the active validator set. nnIn the Cosmos whitepaper, it states that the number of validators on the Hub will increase at a rate of 13% a year until it hits a cap of 300 validators. We propose scrapping this mechanism and instead increasing the max validators to 125 validators in the next chain upgrade with no further planned increases.

The more usage => the bigger the knowledge graph => the more value => the better the quality of the knowledge => the more usage. Transaction fees for basic operations are replaced by lifetime bandwidth, which means usability for both, end-users and developers. You can think of Cyber as a shared ASIC for search.nnYou already see that the idea of Cyber evolves around content identifiers and its ranks. From here, welcome to Decentralized Marketing, or DeMa. You've certainly heard of DeFi. DeFi is built around a simple idea that you can use a collateral for something that will be settled based on a provided price feed. Here comes the systematic problem of DeFi: price oracles. DeMa is based on the same idea of using collateral, but the input for settlement can be information regarding the content identifier itself.nnWith the help of DeMa and IBC chains will be able to prove relevance using content identifiers and their ranks one to another. This will help to grow the IBC ecosystem, where each chain has multiple possibilities to exchange data, which is provably valued.nnCosmos was created to become the internet of blockchains. A protocol that propagates the spirit of decentralization and governed by the community. For such technology to succeed, a lot is required. One thing is a solid foundation it can build on. One virtue of such foundation is monetary flow of income that has to feed this machine for as long as it exists.nnA good question that arises is how to turn the community pool into a pool that isn\u2019t (a) a pot of money which goes solely to network security, (b) a pool that isn\u2019t solely a build-up of inflationary rewards and (\u0441) has long term prosperity value (its value rises).nnThe solution to the above problem is to establish a fund, that is managed and processed collectively and consists of a diversified number of assets that can bring long term value to its stakeholders.nnThis means using the funds to support exceptional projects that are building with Tendermint and Cosmos-SDK. After all, is we want to glorify the ecosystem, we need for it to grow. How will it grow? It will have projects with a clear utility, amazing a product and provable distribution. This will attract users, developers and large stakeholders to the ecosystem. Together we already did one very successful investment decision. We all participated in cosmos fundraizer.

For example, a single address could use 70% of its voting power to vote Yes and 30% of its voting power to vote No. Clients may opt into supporting this feature, as the existing UX of voting for a single option is preserved.nnThis is beneficial because oftentimes the entity owning that address might not be a single individual. For example, a company or organization that owns an address might have different stakeholders who want to vote differently, and so it makes sense to allow them to split their voting power.nnAnother example use case is exchanges and custodians. Many custodians and exchanges custody multiple customers\u2019 ATOMs in the same address and use this address to stake on behalf of them. However, because of this, it makes it infeasible to do 'passthrough voting' and give their customers voting rights over their tokens, if different customers have different voting preferences.
